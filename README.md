# app2
This code is based (like 100% of it) on the tutorial found at:
https://jsao.io/2018/04/creating-a-rest-api-handling-get-requests/


To run it, add this variables to the environment before launching node (yarn dev actually)


export PORT=<port where the webserver is going to be listening>
export DB_USER=<user db>
export DB_PASS=<password of user db>
export DB_CONNECTIONSTRING=<db host ip>:<db port>/<service name>
